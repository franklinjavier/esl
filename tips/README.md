1. **Take notes**

  During the lesson, write new vocabulary and grammar structures that you've learned. With written notes, you have a record that you can review before your next session. 

2. **Record the session**

  Another even more powerful way of doing this is recording your session with your teacher. Listening to your teacher before your next session is a good way to review the previous material and train your ear. If you use Skype to hold your sessions, there are many Skype add-ons (http://shop.skype.com/apps/) that you can use to record your sessions. 

3. **Use a flashcard learning system**

  In your sessions, you'll run into many new vocabulary words and grammar structures. We recommend using flashcard systems that take advantage of Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) to help you memorize them. One of our favorite programs is the free open-source program called Anki (http://www.ankisrs.net/). 

4. **Share what you have learned on a Notebook Entry**

  This is another great way to review what you've learned is to write a notebook entry. This will help you chart your progress on the website. You'll also get the benefit of corrections from community members in case you made a mistake. 

5. **Ask for homework** 

  If you have the time, assigning yourself homework is a very important way to make sure you don't forget what you learn. If you only take lessons once a week, you may find that you're forgetting a great deal. Nobody likes homework, but asking your teacher to assign some simple problems can help you progress over the week. 

6. **Go to italki to practice your language**

  Of course, the best thing you can do is to spend time in the italki community, interacting with native speakers, using the new words and concepts you just learned!
