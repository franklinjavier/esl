# English Grammar in Use - Fourth edition

## Present and Past

### Unit 1 - Present Continuous (I am doing)

We can use the **present continuous** in the following situations:

1. When we want to say that an action is occurring at the exact moment that we are speaking;
2. When we want to say that someone has started to do something, but this action isn't finished yet. So, this person is in the middle of his action;
3. When we talk about things that are occurring at periods around now;
4. When we talk about changes happening around now (consult the list of the verbs in the book).

### Unit 2 - Present Simple (I do)

We use **present simple**:

1. to talk about things that always occur, or things that are true in general;
2. to make questions and negative sentences;
3. to say how often we do things.
