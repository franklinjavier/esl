## Unit 1 - Present Continuous (I am doing)

We can use the **present continuous** in two situations:

1. When we want to say that an action is occurring at the exact moment that we are speaking, or

2. When we want to say that someone has started to do something, but this action isn't finished yet. So, this person is in the middle of his action.
